            <p>NepalMap makes data on Nepal more accessible and understandable.</p>
            <p>NepalMap is of great use to journalists, students, academics and others who are interested in using data to learn about Nepal.</p>
            <p>This tool is a friendly and reliable resource for journalists who want to use data to tell stories or discover stories that are of public interest.</p>
            <p>NepalMap uses the <a href="http://nationaldata.gov.np/" target="_blank">National Data Profile</a>, created by the <a href="http://www.cbs.gov.np/" target="_blank">Central Bureau of Statistics</a>, and other official sources, to create user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues.</p>
            <p>You can <span class="bold">embed, access or download</span> the data too. You can also compare any two areas side-by-side.</p>
            <p>NepalMap is a project of <a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>, a non-profit that works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. Please make a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/117735" target="_blank">tax deductible donation</a> to help us maintain the server space for NepalMap, and empower Nepal digitally!</p>

<p>Yes! NepalMap is based on <a href="https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap" target="_blank">Wazimap</a> which is 
a fork of <a href="https://censusreporter.org/" target="_blank">Census Reporter</a>. Wazimap is built and maintained by <a href="http://code4sa.org/" target="_blank">Code for South Africa</a>. Other implementations include <a href="https://kenya.wazimap.org/" target="_blank">Wazimap Kenya</a> and <a href="https://wazimap.co.za" target="_blank">Wazimap South Africa</a>, the first Wazimap implementation. All of these tools are completely open source. You can build <a href="https://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">one</a> for your country. NepalMap code is licensed under the MIT License.
